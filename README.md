# OpenGLProject
My OpenGL project. Feel free to suggest improvements/new features. All assets and libraries used are free to use, and the code from the Tutorial I used at the start is as well.

# Compilation
Go in the build folder and do `make`.
Required libraries are OpenGL, SDL, Glew and ASSIMP

I have not yet tested this on Windows.
