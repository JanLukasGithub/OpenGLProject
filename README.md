# OpenGLProject
My OpenGL project. Feel free to suggest improvements/new features. All assets and libraries used are free to use, and the code from the Tutorial I used in the beginning is as well.

# Compilation
Go in the build folder and use cmake to build.
Required libraries are [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/), [Glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)

I have not yet tested this on Windows.
